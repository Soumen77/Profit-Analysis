📊 Profit Analysis & Regression | CDA Capstone Project (PRDA-01)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing how R&D Spend, Marketing Spend, and Administrative Costs impact a company’s profit using Python (Machine Learning) and Power BI.
A multiple linear regression model is built to predict profit, and insights are visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze the relationship between company spending and profit

Identify the most influential factors affecting profit

Build a regression model to predict profit for given inputs

Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights
